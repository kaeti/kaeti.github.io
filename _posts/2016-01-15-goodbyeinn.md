Today is my last day at INN. In a couple of weeks, I'll be joining The Washington Post to lead its data/news apps team. It's a bittersweet transition; I'm excited about the new role, and sad to say goodbye to such an amazing and supportive team.

At INN, we've tirelessly [documented our processes and team values](https://github.com/INN/docs). We [redesigned and launched the new inn.org](http://nerds.inn.org/2015/03/10/how-we-redesigned-inn-in-60-days/). We helped dozens of clients and nonprofit news organizations launch new websites. We released [updates for Largo](http://nerds.inn.org/2016/01/14/announcing-largo-0-5-4-improved-navigation-and-social-sharing-tools/). We created a [newsletter](http://investigativenewsnetwork.us1.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=81670c9d1b5fbeba1c29f2865&id=1476113985), hosted a monthly book club, and gathered for weekly office hours. 

There has also been a lot of pie, good meals, ridiculous music, and countless gifs. And I got to work with some of my favorite people â€” the kind of colleagues that make hard work bearable and fun work feel like no work at all. 

Interested in working with these wonderful people? We're [hiring a lead designer](http://inn.org/about/jobs/lead-designer/).

I can't wait to see how INN grows in the future, and I'll continue to follow along as [our members](http://inn.org/members/) publish some of the best in-depth and investigative journalism out there.
