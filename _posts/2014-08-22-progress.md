#### Keep on testing
Nothing is working but that's OK. That's how we learn.

For example, when the site is generated the markdown isn't being interpreted for post permalinks. No idea, but that is next on the list.

Also on the list: 

*  list styles/margins (pages vs. posts)
*  button styles
*  responsive polishes
*  portfolio page with work examples
*  a full write-up on a recent conference session
*  a speaking/events page
*  possibly an art/photo portfolio (perhaps a different site)
