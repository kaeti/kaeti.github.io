title: About
---

I'm a designer and digital journalist based in Minneapolis. Most recently I've been leading the [news apps team](http://www.minnpost.com/data) at MinnPost, where I also manage web development/design and lead strategic digital projects. 

I believe in user-driven design, journalism that solves problems, testing assumptions, iterative change, open source, hiring people who are smarter than me, admitting what I don't know, and treating people as human beings. Kindness or GTFO.

### About the code
Inspired by [Beautiful Open](http://beautifulopen.com/), which was in turn inspired by [Bootstrap Expo](http://expo.getbootstrap.com/)
and [Built With Ember](http://builtwithember.io/). It's built with
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), developed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/kaeti), and is hosted
on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).
