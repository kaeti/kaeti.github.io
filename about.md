title: About
---

I've been working with journalism and technology for more than 10 years. Over the years, I've been an editor, a director of technology, a designer, a photojournalist, a team leader, and a product manager. Regardless of roles and titles, I'm happiest when I'm solving important problems with smart people â€” and helping my team do their best work. 

I'm currently the design director for the [Institute for Nonprofit News](http://www.inn.org). Our product team works to support independent journalism organizations in a number of ways: building and supporting [open source tools](http://largoproject.org), publishing [extensive documentation](http://github.com/inn/docs), and offering consulting and web development. Earlier this year, I managed the [redesign of INN's visual identity](http://nerds.inn.org/2015/03/10/how-we-redesigned-inn-in-60-days/).

Previously, I was the director of news technology for MinnPost, where I managed [web development](https://www.minnpost.com/inside-minnpost/2012/02/new-minnpost) and design, led our [news apps team](http://www.minnpost.com/data), and took the lead on [strategic digital projects](https://www.minnpost.com/inside-minnpost/2014/03/minnpost-and-vosd-launch-joint-knight-funded-project-build-membership-and-su).

I believe in user-driven design, journalism that solves problems, testing assumptions, iterative change, open source, hiring people who are smarter than me, admitting what I don't know, helping others do their best work, and leaving things better than I found them. 

Oh, and I believe that life is more than work and kindness is more critical than success.
